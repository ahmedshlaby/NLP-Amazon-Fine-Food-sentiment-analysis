No more leg cramps! That out ways taste any day!\"\n b\"Ordering my coffee from Amazon is so easy and postage free.  I don't know how they do it but when my box is getting low here comes an offer on my e-mail.  I could buy it at my local grocery for a penny more but the convenience of having coffee delivered to my front door is worth the penny it cost. I don't have to walk in the snow or drive my car for $4.00 per gallon.  Thank you Uncle Amazon\"\n b'I first tried Britt dark roast when I was In Costa Rica.  It has a lot of rich flavor, but it is not bitter at all.  I\\'ve bought<br />it by the case ever since.  It\\'s really no more expensive than those \"gourmet\" brands you find at your local store.  This is<br />simply the best coffee I\\'ve ever had, and I\\'ve tried many supposedly special ones over the years.'\n b'I have tried original, BBQ and salt and vinegar. They all they good, the BBQ is the most flavorful. The salt and vinegar is a bit off, and it kind of has that \"hmm this taste like health food\". Which the BBQ doesn\\'t have that effect at all. Though I\\'m still happy with my purchase. I have always been a fan of Popchips and always recommend my friends and family to eat this instead of their fried trans fatty chips.'\n b\"For anyone who remembers those fudgy little cookies and has been missing them, this is a good news/bad news story.  The bad news--the crisp cookie part of this treat is a chocolate one, unlike the plain vanilla of Fudge Patties past.  The good news--you probably won't notice the difference.<br /><br />For the uninitiated:  this is a lighter, more crisp version of a vanilla wafer (though chocolate), slightly hollowed out to accommodate a dollop of creamy fudge.  The whole thing is then covered in more chocolate.<br /><br />This is no gourmet cookie; but for chocolate lovers who've never forgotten the joy of biting into that thick, creamy fudge layer before  finding the crunchy cookie inside, it's not bad.<br /><br />Serving suggestion:  Best eaten at warm-ish room temp, when the outer blanket of chocolate is just soft enough to be a bit tacky but not messy, allowing your teeth to sink into the inner fudgy layer...with a glass of milk nearby.\"\n b'I love love love tart cherry preserves, and these are among the best I\\'ve ever tasted. The ingredients are: sour cherries, pure cane sugar. As such, they have a texture and color that is much more like homemade than even \"gourmet\" store bought. The color is a deep deep red/purple, almost black. The taste is very tart and delicious cherry, and is a nice contrast to almost anything that is savory or sweet.<br /><br />My only regret is buying the pack of 6 10 oz. jars; the price of 3 18 ox. jars is a much better value. However, without preservatives, I\\'m not sure how long they\\'ll stay fresh in the fridge, so maybe smaller jars are the way to go.'\n b\"I have been trying all the Entress. This one was very good. Still need to lose more weight. So I am staying with MedfitNY. They don't steer you wrong.\"\n b\"The coffee is good. However, at least half of these haven't been sealed correctly. When I brew them the edge of the foil pops open and coffee grounds go everywhere. Not fun to clean. It may have just been the batch we got, but I won't be ordering these again.\"\n b'This is a perfect mat for whenever your cats leave their litter box.  It keeps the litter contained to one area instead of being tracked around the box.'\n b\"These chips are delectably delicious. I am on a low sodium diet. I didn't have to give up totally something that I truely love to snack. These chips are bursting with flavor, and you can't really tell they are missing all that salt. There is just a kiss worth on a chip, but beleive me, it is a total makeout!!!\"]\n[1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1]\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Handle
